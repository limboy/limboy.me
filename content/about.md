## About this blog

This blog is a public learning record of myself, mostly web programming related. I like to deconstruct "hard" and "scary" topics, make them easy to understand and fun to read.

## About me

You can call me Nasi. I'm a software developer live in China. Previously worked at ByteDance and other Chinese companies. I like web programming and learn how underlying systems work(the browser / the os / the network / database, etc), most used languages are `JavaScript`, `TypeScript` and `Rust`.

## Talking to me

My email address is `nasitray/#/gmail.com`. I love hearing from people.
