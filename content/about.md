## About this blog

This blog is about

- explore the wonder of programming (mostly web related).
- showing how topics traditionally considered “hard” and “scary” are actually accessible and interesting and fun.
- how being clear & curious & humble is better than sounding like I know it all already
- experimenting with alternative ways to teach hard concepts
